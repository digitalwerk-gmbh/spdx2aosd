PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The \"Document\", below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as \"you\".  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)  To \"Preserve the Title\"\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\n   unless they release you from this requirement.\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add\n   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\nEntitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\nas expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\ncopy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\nof the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n\n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n    Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the \"with...Texts.\" line with this:\n\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software.\n",

If\n   there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\nEntitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\nas expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\ncopy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\nof the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n\n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n    Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the \"with...Texts.\" line with this:\n\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software.\n",

(\"RN\") has developed Specifications, Source Code implementations and Executables of the Helix DNA Code, and an associated TCK; and\n \nRN desires to license the Helix DNA Code to a large community to facilitate research, innovation and product development while maintaining compatibility of such products with the Helix DNA Code as delivered by RN;\n \nTherefore, RN makes available the Helix DNA Code, the Specifications, and the TCK available for Research and Development Use only under the following terms: \n \nLICENSE\n \n1.  Introduction. \n \nThe RealNetworks Community Source License – Research and Development Use (\"RCSL R&D\" or \"License\") is a license to use the Source Code of certain portions of the Helix DNA Code, Specifications, and the TCK for research and development use only.   You (\"Licensee,\" as more specifically defined below) accept the terms of this License by downloading or using the Helix DNA Code, the Specifications, or the TCK, unless Licensee and RN have signed a license agreement that expressly supersedes this RCSL R&D. \n \nThis License does not include a license to access or modify the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires the right to receive access to the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code for the purposes of porting and optimization, Licensee and RN may elect to execute a Real Format Source Code Porting and Optimization Agreement.\n \nThis License does not include a license to make Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires a license for Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code, Licensee and RN may desire to execute the RealNetworks Community Source License - Commercial Use (\"RCSL Commercial\") for the version of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code of which Licensee would like to make Commercial Use.  Once executed by Licensee and RN, the RCSL Commercial would supersede the terms of this License.\n \nCapitalized terms used in this License are defined in the Glossary attached to the end of this License.\n \n 2.  License Grants.\n \n 2.1  RN Grant to use Covered Code, Specifications, and TCK. \n \nSubject to Licensee’s compliance with the terms of this License, RN grants to Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of RN's Intellectual Property Rights covering the Covered Code, Specifications, and the TCK to do the following:\n \n(a) Research Use License.\n \n(i) use, reproduce and modify the Covered Code and Specifications to create Modifications and Reformatted Specifications for Research Use by Licensee;\n \n(ii) publish and display Covered Code and Specifications with, or as part of Modifications, as permitted under Section 3.1(b) below;\n \n(iii) reproduce and distribute copies of Covered Code to Licensees and students for Research Use by Licensee;\n \n(iv) compile, reproduce and distribute Covered Code in Executable form, and Reformatted Specifications to anyone for Research Use by Licensee; and\n \n(v) use the TCK to develop and test Covered Code.\n \n(b) Reservation of Rights.\n \nOther than the licenses expressly granted in this License, RN retains all right, title, and interest in Covered Code, Specifications and the TCK.\n \n(c)  TCK Use Restrictions.  \n \n                        Licensee may not create derivative works of the TCK or use the TCK to test any implementation of the Specifications except for the purpose of creating Compliant Covered Code.  Licensee may not publish Licensee’s test results or make claims of comparative compatibility with respect to other implementations of the Specification. \n \n2.2 Licensee’s Grants.\n \n(a) To Other Helix Licensees.  Licensee hereby grants to each other Helix Licensee a license to Licensee’s Error Corrections and Shared Modifications, of the same scope and extent as RN's licenses under Section 2.1 (a) above relative to Research Use.\n \n(b) To RN.  Licensee hereby grant to RN a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license, to the extent of Licensee’s Intellectual Property Rights covering Licensee’s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, to use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Licensee’s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, in any form, including the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of distribution.\n \n(c) Other than the licenses expressly granted in Sections 2.2(a) and (b) above, and the restrictions set forth in Section 3.1 below, Licensee retains all right, title, and interest in Licensee’s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications.\n \n2.3 Modifications by Helix Licensees. \n \nLicensee may use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, obtained by Licensee under this License from any other Helix Licensee, to the same scope and extent as with Original Code, Upgraded Code and Specifications.\n \n2.4 Subcontracting. \n \n                        Licensee may deliver the Source Code of Covered Code to other Helix Licensees for the sole purpose of furnishing development services to Licensee in connection with Licensee’s rights granted in this License, provided that Licensee does not enter a separate agreement with such Licensee that contains provisions inconsistent with the ownership and licensing requirements set forth in this License. \n \n3.  Requirements and Responsibilities.\n \n3.1 Research Use License. \n \nAs a condition of exercising the rights granted under Section 2.1(a) above, Licensee must comply with the following:\n \n(a) Licensee’s Contributions.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications which Licensee creates are automatically subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.2 above.  Licensee is encouraged to license all of Licensee’s other Modifications under Section 2.2 as Shared Modifications, but is not required to do so.  Licensee must notify RN of any errors in the Specifications.\n \n(b) Source Code Availability.  Licensee must provide all of Licensee’s Error Corrections to RN as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than when Licensee shares such Error Corrections with any other Helix Licensee.  RN may, at its discretion, post Source Code for Licensee’s Error Corrections and Shared Modifications at the Helix Community Website.  \n \n(c) Notices.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications that Licensee creates or contributes to must include a file documenting the additions and changes Licensee made and the date of such additions and changes.  Licensee must also include the notice set forth in Attachment A-1 in the file header of any Error Correction or Shared Modification.  If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then Licensee must include the notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most likely to look for such a notice.\n \n(d) Redistribution.\n \n(i) Source.  Covered Code may be distributed in Source Code form only to another Helix Licensee (except for students as provided below).  Licensee may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the rights, requirements, or responsibilities of such Helix Licensee.  Licensee may distribute Covered Code to students for use in connection with their course work and research projects undertaken at accredited educational institutions.  Such students need not be Helix Licensees, but must be given a copy of the notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must also be included in a file header or prominent location in the Source Code made available to such students.\n \n(ii) Executable.  Licensee may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered Code to Helix Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection with Research Use by Licensee and under a license of Licensee’s choice, but that limits use of such Executable version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.\n \n(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming.  In connection with Research Use by Licensee only, Licensee may use RN's class, Interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the Source Code files that Licensee modifies.  RN grants to Licensee a limited license to the extent necessary for such purposes. \n \n(e) Extensions. \n \n(i) Licensee may not include any Source Code of Community Code in any Extensions.  Licensee may include the compiled Header Files of Community Code in an Extension provided that Licensee’s use of the Covered Code, including Header Files, complies with the TCK and all other terms of this License.  \n \n(ii) Open.  Licensee must refrain from enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights Licensee may have covering any Interface(s) of Licensee’s Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such Interface(s) by RN or any Helix Licensee.  This obligation does not prevent Licensee from enforcing any Intellectual Property Right Licensee has that would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Licensee’s Extension.\n \n(iii) Interface Modifications and Naming.  Licensee may not modify or add to the GUID space   \"xxxxxxxx-0901-11d1-8B06-00A024406D59\" or any other GUID space designated by RN.  Licensee may not modify any Interface prefix provided with the Covered Code or any other prefix designated by RN. \n \n(f) Any Specifications provided to Licensee by RN are confidential and proprietary information of RN.  Licensee must maintain the confidentiality of the Specifications and may not disclose them to any third party without RN’s prior written consent.  Licensee may only use the Specifications under the terms of this License and only for the purpose of implementing the terms of this License with respect to Community Code.  Licensee may not use, copy or distribute any such Specifications except as provided in writing by RN.\n \nNo Commercial Use. \n \nLicensee may not make Commercial Use of any Covered Code unless Licensee and RN have executed a copy of the RCSL - Commercial available at the Helix Community Website, or another license agreement expressly granting commercial use rights.  \n \n4.  Versions of the License.\n \n4.1 License Versions.\n \nRN may publish revised versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  No one other than RN has the right to promulgate versions of this License.\n \n4.2 Effect of New License Versions.\n \n(a) Once a particular version of Covered Code has been provided under a version of this License, Licensee may always continue to use such Covered Code under the terms of that version of the License.  Licensee may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License, but not under a prior version of the License.  (For example, if a version of Covered Code has been provided under RCSL R&D 2.1, Licensee may not use such Covered Code under RCSL R&D 2.0.) \n \n(b) Version 3.0 of this License (and all subsequent versions) supercedes versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 2.0 of RCSL R&D plus Attachments A-C.\n \n4.3 Multiple-Licensed Code.\n \nRN may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed.\"  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the RN permits Licensee to utilize those designated portions of the Covered Code under Licensee’s choice of this License or the alternative license(s), if any, specified by the RN at the Helix Community Website or in Header Files for the applicable Covered Code. \n \n5.  Disclaimer of Warranty.\n \nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

(\"RN\") has developed Specifications, Source Code implementations and Executables of the Helix DNA Code, and an associated TCK; and\n \nRN desires to license the Helix DNA Code to a large community to facilitate research, innovation and product development while maintaining compatibility of such products with the Helix DNA Code as delivered by RN;\n \nTherefore, RN makes available the Helix DNA Code, the Specifications, and the TCK available for Research and Development Use only under the following terms: \n \nLICENSE\n \n1.  Introduction. \n \nThe RealNetworks Community Source License – Research and Development Use (\"RCSL R&D\" or \"License\") is a license to use the Source Code of certain portions of the Helix DNA Code, Specifications, and the TCK for research and development use only.   You (\"Licensee,\" as more specifically defined below) accept the terms of this License by downloading or using the Helix DNA Code, the Specifications, or the TCK, unless Licensee and RN have signed a license agreement that expressly supersedes this RCSL R&D. \n \nThis License does not include a license to access or modify the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires the right to receive access to the Source Code of the Real Format Client Code for the purposes of porting and optimization, Licensee and RN may elect to execute a Real Format Source Code Porting and Optimization Agreement.\n \nThis License does not include a license to make Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code.  If Licensee desires a license for Commercial Use of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code, Licensee and RN may desire to execute the RealNetworks Community Source License - Commercial Use (\"RCSL Commercial\") for the version of the Helix DNA Code or Real Format Client Code of which Licensee would like to make Commercial Use.  Once executed by Licensee and RN, the RCSL Commercial would supersede the terms of this License.\n \nCapitalized terms used in this License are defined in the Glossary attached to the end of this License.\n \n 2.  License Grants.\n \n 2.1  RN Grant to use Covered Code, Specifications, and TCK. \n \nSubject to Licensee’s compliance with the terms of this License, RN grants to Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of RN's Intellectual Property Rights covering the Covered Code, Specifications, and the TCK to do the following:\n \n(a) Research Use License.\n \n(i) use, reproduce and modify the Covered Code and Specifications to create Modifications and Reformatted Specifications for Research Use by Licensee;\n \n(ii) publish and display Covered Code and Specifications with, or as part of Modifications, as permitted under Section 3.1(b) below;\n \n(iii) reproduce and distribute copies of Covered Code to Licensees and students for Research Use by Licensee;\n \n(iv) compile, reproduce and distribute Covered Code in Executable form, and Reformatted Specifications to anyone for Research Use by Licensee; and\n \n(v) use the TCK to develop and test Covered Code.\n \n(b) Reservation of Rights.\n \nOther than the licenses expressly granted in this License, RN retains all right, title, and interest in Covered Code, Specifications and the TCK.\n \n(c)  TCK Use Restrictions.  \n \n                        Licensee may not create derivative works of the TCK or use the TCK to test any implementation of the Specifications except for the purpose of creating Compliant Covered Code.  Licensee may not publish Licensee’s test results or make claims of comparative compatibility with respect to other implementations of the Specification. \n \n2.2 Licensee’s Grants.\n \n(a) To Other Helix Licensees.  Licensee hereby grants to each other Helix Licensee a license to Licensee’s Error Corrections and Shared Modifications, of the same scope and extent as RN's licenses under Section 2.1 (a) above relative to Research Use.\n \n(b) To RN.  Licensee hereby grant to RN a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license, to the extent of Licensee’s Intellectual Property Rights covering Licensee’s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, to use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Licensee’s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, in any form, including the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of distribution.\n \n(c) Other than the licenses expressly granted in Sections 2.2(a) and (b) above, and the restrictions set forth in Section 3.1 below, Licensee retains all right, title, and interest in Licensee’s Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications.\n \n2.3 Modifications by Helix Licensees. \n \nLicensee may use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, obtained by Licensee under this License from any other Helix Licensee, to the same scope and extent as with Original Code, Upgraded Code and Specifications.\n \n2.4 Subcontracting. \n \n                        Licensee may deliver the Source Code of Covered Code to other Helix Licensees for the sole purpose of furnishing development services to Licensee in connection with Licensee’s rights granted in this License, provided that Licensee does not enter a separate agreement with such Licensee that contains provisions inconsistent with the ownership and licensing requirements set forth in this License. \n \n3.  Requirements and Responsibilities.\n \n3.1 Research Use License. \n \nAs a condition of exercising the rights granted under Section 2.1(a) above, Licensee must comply with the following:\n \n(a) Licensee’s Contributions.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications which Licensee creates are automatically subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.2 above.  Licensee is encouraged to license all of Licensee’s other Modifications under Section 2.2 as Shared Modifications, but is not required to do so.  Licensee must notify RN of any errors in the Specifications.\n \n(b) Source Code Availability.  Licensee must provide all of Licensee’s Error Corrections to RN as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than when Licensee shares such Error Corrections with any other Helix Licensee.  RN may, at its discretion, post Source Code for Licensee’s Error Corrections and Shared Modifications at the Helix Community Website.  \n \n(c) Notices.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications that Licensee creates or contributes to must include a file documenting the additions and changes Licensee made and the date of such additions and changes.  Licensee must also include the notice set forth in Attachment A-1 in the file header of any Error Correction or Shared Modification.  If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then Licensee must include the notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most likely to look for such a notice.\n \n(d) Redistribution.\n \n(i) Source.  Covered Code may be distributed in Source Code form only to another Helix Licensee (except for students as provided below).  Licensee may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the rights, requirements, or responsibilities of such Helix Licensee.  Licensee may distribute Covered Code to students for use in connection with their course work and research projects undertaken at accredited educational institutions.  Such students need not be Helix Licensees, but must be given a copy of the notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must also be included in a file header or prominent location in the Source Code made available to such students.\n \n(ii) Executable.  Licensee may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered Code to Helix Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection with Research Use by Licensee and under a license of Licensee’s choice, but that limits use of such Executable version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.\n \n(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming.  In connection with Research Use by Licensee only, Licensee may use RN's class, Interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the Source Code files that Licensee modifies.  RN grants to Licensee a limited license to the extent necessary for such purposes. \n \n(e) Extensions. \n \n(i) Licensee may not include any Source Code of Community Code in any Extensions.  Licensee may include the compiled Header Files of Community Code in an Extension provided that Licensee’s use of the Covered Code, including Header Files, complies with the TCK and all other terms of this License.  \n \n(ii) Open.  Licensee must refrain from enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights Licensee may have covering any Interface(s) of Licensee’s Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such Interface(s) by RN or any Helix Licensee.  This obligation does not prevent Licensee from enforcing any Intellectual Property Right Licensee has that would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Licensee’s Extension.\n \n(iii) Interface Modifications and Naming.  Licensee may not modify or add to the GUID space   \"xxxxxxxx-0901-11d1-8B06-00A024406D59\" or any other GUID space designated by RN.  Licensee may not modify any Interface prefix provided with the Covered Code or any other prefix designated by RN. \n \n(f) Any Specifications provided to Licensee by RN are confidential and proprietary information of RN.  Licensee must maintain the confidentiality of the Specifications and may not disclose them to any third party without RN’s prior written consent.  Licensee may only use the Specifications under the terms of this License and only for the purpose of implementing the terms of this License with respect to Community Code.  Licensee may not use, copy or distribute any such Specifications except as provided in writing by RN.\n \nNo Commercial Use. \n \nLicensee may not make Commercial Use of any Covered Code unless Licensee and RN have executed a copy of the RCSL - Commercial available at the Helix Community Website, or another license agreement expressly granting commercial use rights.  \n \n4.  Versions of the License.\n \n4.1 License Versions.\n \nRN may publish revised versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  No one other than RN has the right to promulgate versions of this License.\n \n4.2 Effect of New License Versions.\n \n(a) Once a particular version of Covered Code has been provided under a version of this License, Licensee may always continue to use such Covered Code under the terms of that version of the License.  Licensee may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License, but not under a prior version of the License.  (For example, if a version of Covered Code has been provided under RCSL R&D 2.1, Licensee may not use such Covered Code under RCSL R&D 2.0.) \n \n(b) Version 3.0 of this License (and all subsequent versions) supercedes versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 2.0 of RCSL R&D plus Attachments A-C.\n \n4.3 Multiple-Licensed Code.\n \nRN may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed.\"  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the RN permits Licensee to utilize those designated portions of the Covered Code under Licensee’s choice of this License or the alternative license(s), if any, specified by the RN at the Helix Community Website or in Header Files for the applicable Covered Code. \n \n5.

Termination.\n \n6.1 By Licensee.\n \nLicensee may terminate this License at anytime by providing written notice to RN.\n \n6.2 By RN.\n \nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:\n \n(a) automatically if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this License and fails to cure such breach within 30 days of receipt of written notice of the breach;\n \n(b) immediately in the event of circumstances specified in Sections 7.1 and 8.4; or\n \n(c) at RN's discretion upon any action initiated by Licensee (including by cross-claim or counter claim) alleging that use or distribution by RN or any Licensee, of any Covered Code, the TCK or Specifications infringe a patent owned or controlled by Licensee.\n \n6.3 Effect of Termination. \n \nUpon termination, Licensee must discontinue use of and destroy all copies of Covered Code in Licensee’s possession.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code that Licensee has properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.  Provisions that, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive including, without limitation, Sections 2.2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and the Glossary.\n \n6.4 No Compensation.\n \nEach party waives and releases the other from any claim to compensation or indemnity for permitted or lawful termination of the business relationship established by this License.\n \n7.  Liability.\n \n7.1 Infringement. \n \nShould any of the Covered Code, TCK or Specifications (\"Materials\") become the subject of a claim of infringement, RN may, at its sole option, (i) attempt to procure the rights necessary for Licensee to continue using the Materials, (ii) modify the Materials so that they are no longer infringing, or (iii) terminate Licensee’s right to use the Materials, immediately upon written notice. \n \n                        7.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \n                         \n                        TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RN'S LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS LICENSE, WHETHER FOR BREACH OR IN TORT, SHALL BE LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) OF THE AMOUNT HAVING THEN ACTUALLY BEEN PAID BY LICENSEE TO RN FOR ALL COPIES LICENSED HEREUNDER OF THE PARTICULAR ITEMS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM, IF ANY, DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIMED BREACH.

					"text": "JELURIDA PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nPreamble:\n\nBeing a company engaged predominantly in the creation of blockchain technology,\nJelurida IP B.V. has prepared the following “coinleft” license whose goal is to\nimplement new requirements consistent with the specific nature of the blockchain\nsoftware. We recognize the fundamental advantages that the decentralized ledger\ntechnology has to offer and we truly believe in its potential to change the\nworld for the better. Therefore we wish to continue the already established\ntradition to publish blockchain software as an open source and in this way to\ngive our contribution to the further development of the blockchain technology\nworld-wide. At the same time we wish to protect our IP rights and to address the\nfact that our software was copied many times during its existence and as a\nresult a lot of “clones” have been created which dilute the value of the tokens\nwith no significant technological improvements behind them.\n\nThe exact terms and conditions for using, copying and modification follow:\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nI. General Conditions\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe existent copyleft licensing models were designed to protect the value of the\ncode which is created in open source projects. They make sure anyone who builds\non top of this code also releases their code under the same copyleft license,\nthus sharing back with the community and the developers of the original project\nthe added value of the derived work.\n\nCopyleft licenses however were created long before crypto currency and\nblockchain technologies appeared, and could not have anticipated the fact that\ntoday the value of an open source distributed ledger project is contained not\nonly in the program code being written, but in the unique public blockchain\ninstance or crypto currency token, maintained by this project, with its\ndevelopers, community and holders sharing the common interest to preserve and\nincrease the value of this blockchain token.\n\nCrypto currency tokens today have value of their own, people can buy, sell and\ninvest in them and the unlimited permission of cloning the existing blockchain\nplatforms and creating new coins inevitably results in decreasing the value of\nthe original tokens.\n\nCrypto currency tokens are also an inseparable part of each distributed ledger\nsoftware, without which such software cannot really be used. Ensuring that a\nclone project shares back the modified source code is no longer sufficient to\nallow the users of the original project access to that derived work, unless they\nare also allocated some of the newly created tokens in the clone blockchain\ninstance. Thus such allocation is important in order to preserve not only the\nvalue of the original tokens, but also to preserve the users freedom to use any\nworks derived from the original software.\n\nWith the above being said, the terms and conditions for using, copying and\nmodification of distributed ledger software programs are outlined below, called\nthe Jelurida Public License (JPL). The JPL is inspired by the GNU General Public\nLicense versions 2 and 3, with adaptations specifically aimed at application of\nthe license to distributed ledger software programs; as such the GNU General\nPublic License and any other license terms and conditions other than this JPL\nare explicitly excluded.\n\n\nJPL version: 1.1\n\n\nArticle 0. Definitions:\n\n“based on [the Program/Covered Work/…]” means derived from the original Covered\nWork (or part thereof) by the act(s) of copying it, modifying it, including it\n(in whole or in part) or by linking to the original Covered Work (or part\nthereof).\n\n“to convey”: To convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a\ncomputer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nCopyright Holder, Licensor: The owner of the IP rights over the software as\ndetermined by applicable national law and international treaty provisions\nregulating this subject matter.\n\nCorresponding Source: The Corresponding Source for a work in Object Code form\nmeans all the Source Code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the Object Code and to modify the work, including scripts to control\nthose activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or\ngeneral-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used\nunmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.\nFor example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated\nwith source files for the work, and the Source Code for shared libraries and\ndynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to\nrequire, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not\ninclude anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the\nCorresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in Source Code form is\nthat same work.\n\nCovered Work: A DLT Software or another Program based on a DLT or otherwise, or\nbased on another Covered Work, their Object Code and Source Code, and any other\nwork covered by this License according to their terms.\n\nDLT Instance: Unique instance of distributed ledger consisting of a network of\none or more participants (nodes) running a particular DLT Software and which\nnodes are in a state of consensus with each other within the permitted\ntolerances of the applicable consensus algorithm. An example of such DLT\ninstance is the Nxt public blockchain.\n\nDLT Software: Any distributed ledger computer technology including but not\nlimited to blockchain technology regardless of the way the consensus is\nestablished.\n\nGeneral Conditions: Chapter I. General Conditions of this License.\n\nLicense: This Jelurida Public License (JPL) consisting of both General\nConditions and Special Conditions.\n\nLicensee, You: Everyone (natural person or legal entity) who wants to use, copy,\ndistribute, modify or build on top of the Program.\n\n“to modify”: To modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the\nwork in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier\nwork or a “work based on” the earlier work. Modification also includes\ntranslation into another programming language or human language.\n\nObject Code: Any non-Source Code form of a work.\n\nProgram: Any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\n\n“to propagate”: To propagate a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\napplicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a\nprivate copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without\nmodification), making available to the public, and in some countries other\nactivities as well.\n\nSource Code: The Source Code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.\n\nSpecial Conditions: Chapter II. Special Conditions of this License which\ncontains additional provisions required and adapted by the Licensor according to\nthe specific Covered Work they are applicable to.\n\nStandard Interface: An interface that either is an official standard defined by\na recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a\nparticular programming language, one that is widely used among developers\nworking in that language.\n\nSystem Libraries: Libraries of an executable work, other than the work as a\nwhole, that (a) are included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,\nbut which are not part of that Major Component, and (b) serve only to enable use\nof the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for\nwhich an implementation is available to the public in Source Code form. A Major\nComponent, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window\nsystem, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the\nexecutable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an Object Code\ninterpreter used to run it.\n\n\nArticle 1. Scope of the License:\n\n1.1 This License applies to any Covered Work or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the Copyright Holder saying it may be used, propagated,\nconveyed or modified only under the terms of this License. It also applies to\nany work which is not a DLT per se but is still a Covered Work because it is\nbased on the covered DLT Software or contains a portion of it. This is to ensure\nthat if such work is included into another DLT Software that DLT Software must\nsatisfy the below stated airdrop requirement and other terms of this License.\n\n1.2. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright\non the Covered Work, and are irrevocable provided the conditions of this License\nare met.\n\n1.3 The act of running a Program is not restricted as long as it does not\nviolate Article 3.4 of the General Conditions, and the output from a Program is\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\nof having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\nwhat the Program does.\n\n1.4 Conveying is permitted solely under the conditions stated herein.\nSublicensing is not allowed; Article 7 of the General Conditions makes it\nunnecessary.\n\n1.5 No Covered Work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\nunder any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\ncopyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\nrestricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a Covered Work, you\nwaive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the\nextent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License\nwith respect to the Covered Work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the\nwork's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n\nArticle 2.\n\n2.1 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Covered Work’s Source\nCode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Covered\nWork a copy of this License along with the Covered Work.\n\n2.2 You must keep intact all authorship and copyright notices and when conveying\nor offering to convey copies (verbatim or modified) you must also avoid any\nmisrepresentation of the origin of the Covered Work. You must make sure that any\nmodified versions of such Covered Work are marked in reasonable ways as\ndifferent from the original version and they do not imply any endorsement or\nsupport by the Copyright Holder regarding this modified work.\n\n2.3 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy (for the\navoidance of doubt, such physical act of transfer may include making the copy\navailable on your website or otherwise), and you may at your discretion and\nresponsibility offer support or warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You\nare not allowed to charge any fee for granting the right to further use,\npropagate, convey or modify the copy then obtained by the acquirer, as such\nwould be against the intention of this License.\n\n\nArticle 3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Covered Work or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Covered Work, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Article 2 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n3.1 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\nyou changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n3.2 You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in\npart contains or is derived from the Covered Work or any part thereof, to be\nlicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\nLicense.\n\n3.3 If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\nmust cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\nordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\ncopyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\nyou provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under the\nconditions of this License, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense. (Exception: if the Covered Work itself is interactive but does not\nnormally print such an announcement, your work based on the Covered Work is not\nrequired to print an announcement.) If the program has graphical user interface\nany such notices should be placed in an about dialog or similar.\n\n3.4 If the Covered Work is a DLT Software, after your modifications it must\ncontinue to work with the original DLT Instance without violating the consensus\nalgorithm or resulting in a permanent fork. For the purpose of this clause\nmodification also includes changing the configuration or network environment in\nwhich the Covered Work is run that results in permanent disconnection, fork or\nisolation from the original DLT Instance. If your modifications result in a\ndifferent DLT Instance you must satisfy the following airdrop requirement:\n\n3.4.1 The token holders from the original distributed ledger instance shall be\nallocated a portion (an \"airdrop\") of the tokens in that new DLT Instance\nproportional to their token balances. This shall also apply to anyone who\nintends to make a copy of your copy, i.e. any such person needs to allocate the\nsame airdrop of the newly created tokens to the account holders from the\noriginal DLT Instance (not to your copy). If the Covered Work is not a DLT\nSoftware per se this requirement still applies to any other work based on or\nincluding this work or portions of it which is a DLT Software or in any other\nway distributes tokens to its users. The specific percentage of the airdrop\nand the tokens to which it applies, which may also depend on how the new DLT\nInstance relates to the original one, are defined in the Special Conditions.\n\n3.5 All other provisions, designated in the Special Conditions and consistent\nwith the specific requirements arising from the architecture of each particular\ndecentralized ledger/consensus platform, are observed as well.\n\n3.6 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Covered Work, and can be\nreasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this\nLicense, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you convey them as\nseparate works. But when you convey the same sections as part of a whole which\nis a work based on the Covered Work, the conveyance of the whole must be on the\nterms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Mere\naggregation of another work not based on the Covered Work with the Covered Work\n(or with a work based on the Covered Work) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n\nArticle 4. You may convey a Covered Work in Object Code form under the terms of\nArticles 2 and 3 of the General Conditions, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of\nthese ways:\n\n4.1 Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\nphysical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on\na durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n4.2 Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\nphysical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at\nleast three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer\nsupport for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the Object Code\neither (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your\nreasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access\nto copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n4.3 Convey individual copies of the Object Code with a copy of the written offer\nto provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\noccasionally and non-commercially, and only if you received the Object Code with\nsuch an offer, in accord with Article 4.2 above.\n\n4.4 Convey the Object Code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or\nfor a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the\nsame way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require\nrecipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the Object Code. If the\nplace to copy the Object Code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may\nbe on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports\nequivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to\nthe Object Code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of\nwhat server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that\nit is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n4.5 Convey the Object Code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform\nother peers where the Object Code and Corresponding Source of the work are being\noffered to the general public at no charge under Article 4.4 above.\n\n4.6 A separable portion of the Object Code, whose Source Code is excluded from\nthe Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying\nthe Object Code work.\n\n\nArticle 5. You may not use, copy, modify, or propagate the Covered Work except\nas expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to use, copy,\nmodify or  propagate the Covered Work is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n\nArticle 6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, use, modify or\npropagate Covered Works. These actions are prohibited if you do not accept this\nLicense. Therefore, by modifying or propagating the Covered Work, you indicate\nyour acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for,\nas specified in the General Conditions and Special Conditions, copying, using,\npropagating or modifying the Covered Work.\n\n\nArticle 7. Each time you convey the Covered Work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original Licensor to use, copy, propagate or modify\nthe Covered Work subject to terms and conditions at least equal and in\naccordance with this License. In this regard, the license granted on behalf of\nthe original Licensor by the propagator of the Covered Work may amend this\nLicense only to the following extent:\n\n7.1 You can add additional airdrop requirements towards the holders of your\nunique DLT Instance as long as those do not in any way reduce or interfere with\nthe airdrop owed to the original DLT Instance account holders.\n\n7.2 If the distribution and/or use of the Covered Work is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents, by copyrighted interfaces or by law, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Covered Work under this License may add an\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n\nArticle 8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not propagate the Covered Work at\nall. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Covered Work by all those who receive copies directly or\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Covered Work.\n\n\nArticle 9. Jelurida IP B.V. may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nJelurida Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns. To avoid ambiguity, everyone who wishes to use the text of the\nJelurida Public License must always specify under which version of the JPL\ntheir Covered Work is released.\n\n\nArticle 10. Every Copyright Holder is permitted to use the text of the Jelurida\nPublic License for their own Covered Work provided that they: (i) keep the name\nJelurida Public License (you can append the name of the specific DLT Instance,\ne.g. \"Jelurida Public License version 1.0 for the Nxt Public Blockchain\"),\n(ii) remove the Preamble and (iii) do not change the General Conditions. Every\nCopyright Holder is permitted to adapt the Special Conditions to their specific\ncase under (i), (ii) and (iii) above to the extent that they do not contradict\nthe General Conditions nor the spirit of the Jelurida Public License.\n\n\nArticle 11. If the Special Conditions contradict the General Conditions or any\npart of them, the provisions of the General Conditions shall take precedence.\n\n\nArticle 12. If you cannot satisfy Article 3.4 and 3.4.1 of the General\nConditions or you are not willing to do so, or if you require a customized DLT\nInstance for internal use (i.e. a private blockchain) based on the DLT Software\nyou must obtain permission or purchase a commercial license from the original\nCopyright Holder however he is not in any way obliged to grant permission or\nsell such a license.\n\n\nArticle 13. No warranty\n\nTHE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE COVERED WORK \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nCOVERED WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE COVERED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\nArticle 14.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDER OR ANY OTHER PARTY  WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nCOVERED WORK AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL  OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE COVERED WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR\nDATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE COVERED WORK TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH\nHOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU\nINDEMNIFY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONVEYOR OF THE COVERED WORK OF ANY LIABILITY\nVIS-À-VIS ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE COVERED WORK AS USED, COPIED,\nPROPAGATED OR MODIFIED BY YOU.\n\n\nArticle 15.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot\nbe given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall\napply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil\nliability in connection with the Covered Work, unless a warranty or assumption\nof liability accompanies a copy of the Covered Work in return for a fee.\n\n\nII. Special Conditions\n\nArticle 0. The Copyright Holder of the Nxt Reference Software (NRS) is Jelurida\nIP B.V.\n\n\nArticle 1. The airdrop requirement of Article 3.4.1 of the General Conditions,\nas related to the Nxt Reference Software (NRS) is the following:\n\n1.1 The NXT holders from the original Nxt Public Blockchain Platform as\nmaintained by Jelurida Swiss SA must be allocated at least 10% (ten percent) of\nthe forging tokens in the new DLT Instance, proportional to their NXT holdings,\n\nOR\n\n1.2 The forging token holders from a DLT Instance which is based on the NRS that\nhas already satisfied the JPL airdrop requirement, are allocated 100% (one\nhundred percent) of the forging tokens in that new DLT Instance, proportional to\ntheir forging token holdings.\n\nThe first case covers clones and forks of the Nxt platform, and ensures that NXT\nowners will receive an airdrop from any such clone or fork launched in the\nfuture, or any existing Nxt clone that decides to upgrade to this NRS version or\ncopy or backport code from it.\n\nThe second case is to cover forks of Nxt clones which have already satisfied the\nJPL airdrop, as by definition at the time of the hard fork all accounts start\nwith the same balances on either fork, and it would be difficult to make a hard\nfork satisfy the first condition. The Nxt holders who received the airdrop\nwould still have the same balances on either fork.\n\n\nArticle 2. In both cases (Articles 1.1 or 1.2 of the Special Conditions), token\nholdings must be calculated based on a snapshot taken not earlier than 3 months\nbefore the launch of the new DLT Instance. For a new DLT Instance, the snapshot\nshould also be taken not later than 24 h before the launch, to avoid the\nuncertainty due to the 720 blocks rolling checkpoint.\n\n\nArticle 3.\n\n3.1 There should be under no circumstances any restrictions or any type of\ndiscrimination against accounts receiving tokens as an airdrop.\n\n3.2 If token distribution must be restricted by some criteria that not all\nexisting NXT holders can potentially satisfy, a specific exemption from the full\nJPL airdrop requirements must be obtained in advance. The Copyright Holder\nreserves the right to not grant such exemption, or to require a commercial\nlicense in such situations, to be decided on a case by case basis.\n\n3.3 As internal (private) use of Nxt software for evaluating and testing\npurposes cannot satisfy the JPL airdrop requirement, any such use will also\nrequire an evaluation license agreement with the Copyright Holder if it lasts\nlonger than 3 months.\n\n3.4 Nothing in this license shall be understood as giving NXT token holders the\nright to hold the Licensor, its affiliate parties, or sublicensors, liable in\ncase the NXT holders do not obtain any airdrop, or liable for not taking action\nto enforce the airdrop requirement, or for not observing, verifying or\nmonitoring the compliance with any airdrop. The Licensor also retains the right\nto change the percentage of the airdrop requirement in Article 1.1 or to\ncompletely eliminate this airdrop requirement at any time.\n\n\nArticle 4. DLT Instances that by design do not use a fixed number of tokens\nissued all at once, or that have substituted the proof-of-stake algorithm with a\ndifferent one and as a result do not use forging tokens, have to contact the\nCopyright Holder for a custom license agreement. However the Copyright Holder is\nin no way obliged to provide such a custom license.\n\n\nArticle 5. Interpretation\nYou agree that you may not, for the purpose of interpretation of this License,\nrefer to, or construe this License on the basis of, or use as counterevidence,\nany prior agreements, arrangements, understandings and statements, or other\nbilateral or public licenses, and to this extent agree (i) that this License\nqualifies as an agreed rule of evidence within the meaning of article 153 Dutch\nCode of Civil Proceedings and (ii) that this clause serves as a determination\nagreement within the meaning of article 7:900 Dutch Civil Code, and that this\nLicense shall be interpreted or construed by assuming the most obvious\ngrammatical meaning of the wording of this License.\n\n\nArticle 6. Governing law\nThis License, the documents related to it and any agreement that incorporates\nany of these are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws\nof the Netherlands. Any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with\nthis License, the documents related to it and any agreement that incorporates\nany of these shall be exclusively referred to the competent court in Amsterdam,\nthe Netherlands.",

They make sure anyone who builds\non top of this code also releases their code under the same copyleft license,\nthus sharing back with the community and the developers of the original project\nthe added value of the derived work.\n\nCopyleft licenses however were created long before crypto currency and\nblockchain technologies appeared, and could not have anticipated the fact that\ntoday the value of an open source distributed ledger project is contained not\nonly in the program code being written, but in the unique public blockchain\ninstance or crypto currency token, maintained by this project, with its\ndevelopers, community and holders sharing the common interest to preserve and\nincrease the value of this blockchain token.\n\nCrypto currency tokens today have value of their own, people can buy, sell and\ninvest in them and the unlimited permission of cloning the existing blockchain\nplatforms and creating new coins inevitably results in decreasing the value of\nthe original tokens.\n\nCrypto currency tokens are also an inseparable part of each distributed ledger\nsoftware, without which such software cannot really be used. Ensuring that a\nclone project shares back the modified source code is no longer sufficient to\nallow the users of the original project access to that derived work, unless they\nare also allocated some of the newly created tokens in the clone blockchain\ninstance. Thus such allocation is important in order to preserve not only the\nvalue of the original tokens, but also to preserve the users freedom to use any\nworks derived from the original software.\n\nWith the above being said, the terms and conditions for using, copying and\nmodification of distributed ledger software programs are outlined below, called\nthe Jelurida Public License (JPL). The JPL is inspired by the GNU General Public\nLicense versions 2 and 3, with adaptations specifically aimed at application of\nthe license to distributed ledger software programs; as such the GNU General\nPublic License and any other license terms and conditions other than this JPL\nare explicitly excluded.\n\n\nJPL version: 1.1\n\n\nArticle 0. Definitions:\n\n“based on [the Program/Covered Work/…]” means derived from the original Covered\nWork (or part thereof) by the act(s) of copying it, modifying it, including it\n(in whole or in part) or by linking to the original Covered Work (or part\nthereof).\n\n“to convey”: To convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a\ncomputer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nCopyright Holder, Licensor: The owner of the IP rights over the software as\ndetermined by applicable national law and international treaty provisions\nregulating this subject matter.\n\nCorresponding Source: The Corresponding Source for a work in Object Code form\nmeans all the Source Code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the Object Code and to modify the work, including scripts to control\nthose activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or\ngeneral-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used\nunmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.\nFor example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated\nwith source files for the work, and the Source Code for shared libraries and\ndynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to\nrequire, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not\ninclude anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the\nCorresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in Source Code form is\nthat same work.\n\nCovered Work: A DLT Software or another Program based on a DLT or otherwise, or\nbased on another Covered Work, their Object Code and Source Code, and any other\nwork covered by this License according to their terms.\n\nDLT Instance: Unique instance of distributed ledger consisting of a network of\none or more participants (nodes) running a particular DLT Software and which\nnodes are in a state of consensus with each other within the permitted\ntolerances of the applicable consensus algorithm. An example of such DLT\ninstance is the Nxt public blockchain.\n\nDLT Software: Any distributed ledger computer technology including but not\nlimited to blockchain technology regardless of the way the consensus is\nestablished.\n\nGeneral Conditions: Chapter I. General Conditions of this License.\n\nLicense: This Jelurida Public License (JPL) consisting of both General\nConditions and Special Conditions.\n\nLicensee, You: Everyone (natural person or legal entity) who wants to use, copy,\ndistribute, modify or build on top of the Program.\n\n“to modify”: To modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the\nwork in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier\nwork or a “work based on” the earlier work. Modification also includes\ntranslation into another programming language or human language.\n\nObject Code: Any non-Source Code form of a work.\n\nProgram: Any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\n\n“to propagate”: To propagate a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\napplicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a\nprivate copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without\nmodification), making available to the public, and in some countries other\nactivities as well.\n\nSource Code: The Source Code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.\n\nSpecial Conditions: Chapter II. Special Conditions of this License which\ncontains additional provisions required and adapted by the Licensor according to\nthe specific Covered Work they are applicable to.\n\nStandard Interface: An interface that either is an official standard defined by\na recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a\nparticular programming language, one that is widely used among developers\nworking in that language.\n\nSystem Libraries: Libraries of an executable work, other than the work as a\nwhole, that (a) are included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,\nbut which are not part of that Major Component, and (b) serve only to enable use\nof the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for\nwhich an implementation is available to the public in Source Code form. A Major\nComponent, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window\nsystem, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the\nexecutable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an Object Code\ninterpreter used to run it.\n\n\nArticle 1. Scope of the License:\n\n1.1 This License applies to any Covered Work or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the Copyright Holder saying it may be used, propagated,\nconveyed or modified only under the terms of this License. It also applies to\nany work which is not a DLT per se but is still a Covered Work because it is\nbased on the covered DLT Software or contains a portion of it. This is to ensure\nthat if such work is included into another DLT Software that DLT Software must\nsatisfy the below stated airdrop requirement and other terms of this License.\n\n1.2. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright\non the Covered Work, and are irrevocable provided the conditions of this License\nare met.\n\n1.3 The act of running a Program is not restricted as long as it does not\nviolate Article 3.4 of the General Conditions, and the output from a Program is\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\nof having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\nwhat the Program does.\n\n1.4 Conveying is permitted solely under the conditions stated herein.\nSublicensing is not allowed; Article 7 of the General Conditions makes it\nunnecessary.\n\n1.5 No Covered Work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\nunder any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\ncopyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\nrestricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a Covered Work, you\nwaive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the\nextent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License\nwith respect to the Covered Work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the\nwork's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n\nArticle 2.\n\n2.1 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Covered Work’s Source\nCode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Covered\nWork a copy of this License along with the Covered Work.\n\n2.2 You must keep intact all authorship and copyright notices and when conveying\nor offering to convey copies (verbatim or modified) you must also avoid any\nmisrepresentation of the origin of the Covered Work. You must make sure that any\nmodified versions of such Covered Work are marked in reasonable ways as\ndifferent from the original version and they do not imply any endorsement or\nsupport by the Copyright Holder regarding this modified work.\n\n2.3 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy (for the\navoidance of doubt, such physical act of transfer may include making the copy\navailable on your website or otherwise), and you may at your discretion and\nresponsibility offer support or warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You\nare not allowed to charge any fee for granting the right to further use,\npropagate, convey or modify the copy then obtained by the acquirer, as such\nwould be against the intention of this License.\n\n\nArticle 3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Covered Work or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Covered Work, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Article 2 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n3.1 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\nyou changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n3.2 You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in\npart contains or is derived from the Covered Work or any part thereof, to be\nlicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\nLicense.\n\n3.3 If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\nmust cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\nordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\ncopyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\nyou provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under the\nconditions of this License, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense. (Exception: if the Covered Work itself is interactive but does not\nnormally print such an announcement, your work based on the Covered Work is not\nrequired to print an announcement.) If the program has graphical user interface\nany such notices should be placed in an about dialog or similar.\n\n3.4 If the Covered Work is a DLT Software, after your modifications it must\ncontinue to work with the original DLT Instance without violating the consensus\nalgorithm or resulting in a permanent fork. For the purpose of this clause\nmodification also includes changing the configuration or network environment in\nwhich the Covered Work is run that results in permanent disconnection, fork or\nisolation from the original DLT Instance. If your modifications result in a\ndifferent DLT Instance you must satisfy the following airdrop requirement:\n\n3.4.1 The token holders from the original distributed ledger instance shall be\nallocated a portion (an \"airdrop\") of the tokens in that new DLT Instance\nproportional to their token balances. This shall also apply to anyone who\nintends to make a copy of your copy, i.e. any such person needs to allocate the\nsame airdrop of the newly created tokens to the account holders from the\noriginal DLT Instance (not to your copy). If the Covered Work is not a DLT\nSoftware per se this requirement still applies to any other work based on or\nincluding this work or portions of it which is a DLT Software or in any other\nway distributes tokens to its users. The specific percentage of the airdrop\nand the tokens to which it applies, which may also depend on how the new DLT\nInstance relates to the original one, are defined in the Special Conditions.\n\n3.5 All other provisions, designated in the Special Conditions and consistent\nwith the specific requirements arising from the architecture of each particular\ndecentralized ledger/consensus platform, are observed as well.\n\n3.6 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Covered Work, and can be\nreasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this\nLicense, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you convey them as\nseparate works. But when you convey the same sections as part of a whole which\nis a work based on the Covered Work, the conveyance of the whole must be on the\nterms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Mere\naggregation of another work not based on the Covered Work with the Covered Work\n(or with a work based on the Covered Work) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n\nArticle 4. You may convey a Covered Work in Object Code form under the terms of\nArticles 2 and 3 of the General Conditions, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of\nthese ways:\n\n4.1 Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\nphysical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on\na durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n4.2 Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\nphysical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at\nleast three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer\nsupport for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the Object Code\neither (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your\nreasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access\nto copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n4.3 Convey individual copies of the Object Code with a copy of the written offer\nto provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\noccasionally and non-commercially, and only if you received the Object Code with\nsuch an offer, in accord with Article 4.2 above.\n\n4.4 Convey the Object Code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or\nfor a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the\nsame way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require\nrecipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the Object Code. If the\nplace to copy the Object Code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may\nbe on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports\nequivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to\nthe Object Code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of\nwhat server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that\nit is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n4.5 Convey the Object Code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform\nother peers where the Object Code and Corresponding Source of the work are being\noffered to the general public at no charge under Article 4.4 above.\n\n4.6 A separable portion of the Object Code, whose Source Code is excluded from\nthe Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying\nthe Object Code work.\n\n\nArticle 5. You may not use, copy, modify, or propagate the Covered Work except\nas expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to use, copy,\nmodify or  propagate the Covered Work is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n\nArticle 6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, use, modify or\npropagate Covered Works. These actions are prohibited if you do not accept this\nLicense. Therefore, by modifying or propagating the Covered Work, you indicate\nyour acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for,\nas specified in the General Conditions and Special Conditions, copying, using,\npropagating or modifying the Covered Work.\n\n\nArticle 7. Each time you convey the Covered Work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original Licensor to use, copy, propagate or modify\nthe Covered Work subject to terms and conditions at least equal and in\naccordance with this License. In this regard, the license granted on behalf of\nthe original Licensor by the propagator of the Covered Work may amend this\nLicense only to the following extent:\n\n7.1 You can add additional airdrop requirements towards the holders of your\nunique DLT Instance as long as those do not in any way reduce or interfere with\nthe airdrop owed to the original DLT Instance account holders.\n\n7.2 If the distribution and/or use of the Covered Work is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents, by copyrighted interfaces or by law, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Covered Work under this License may add an\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n\nArticle 8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not propagate the Covered Work at\nall. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Covered Work by all those who receive copies directly or\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Covered Work.\n\n\nArticle 9. Jelurida IP B.V. may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nJelurida Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns. To avoid ambiguity, everyone who wishes to use the text of the\nJelurida Public License must always specify under which version of the JPL\ntheir Covered Work is released.\n\n\nArticle 10. Every Copyright Holder is permitted to use the text of the Jelurida\nPublic License for their own Covered Work provided that they: (i) keep the name\nJelurida Public License (you can append the name of the specific DLT Instance,\ne.g. \"Jelurida Public License version 1.0 for the Nxt Public Blockchain\"),\n(ii) remove the Preamble and (iii) do not change the General Conditions. Every\nCopyright Holder is permitted to adapt the Special Conditions to their specific\ncase under (i), (ii) and (iii) above to the extent that they do not contradict\nthe General Conditions nor the spirit of the Jelurida Public License.\n\n\nArticle 11. If the Special Conditions contradict the General Conditions or any\npart of them, the provisions of the General Conditions shall take precedence.\n\n\nArticle 12. If you cannot satisfy Article 3.4 and 3.4.1 of the General\nConditions or you are not willing to do so, or if you require a customized DLT\nInstance for internal use (i.e. a private blockchain) based on the DLT Software\nyou must obtain permission or purchase a commercial license from the original\nCopyright Holder however he is not in any way obliged to grant permission or\nsell such a license.\n\n\nArticle 13. No warranty\n\nTHE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE COVERED WORK \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nCOVERED WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE COVERED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\nArticle 14.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDER OR ANY OTHER PARTY  WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nCOVERED WORK AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL  OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE COVERED WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR\nDATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE COVERED WORK TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH\nHOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU\nINDEMNIFY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONVEYOR OF THE COVERED WORK OF ANY LIABILITY\nVIS-À-VIS ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE COVERED WORK AS USED, COPIED,\nPROPAGATED OR MODIFIED BY YOU.\n\n\nArticle 15.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot\nbe given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall\napply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil\nliability in connection with the Covered Work, unless a warranty or assumption\nof liability accompanies a copy of the Covered Work in return for a fee.\n\n\nII. Special Conditions\n\nArticle 0. The Copyright Holder of the Nxt Reference Software (NRS) is Jelurida\nIP B.V.\n\n\nArticle 1. The airdrop requirement of Article 3.4.1 of the General Conditions,\nas related to the Nxt Reference Software (NRS) is the following:\n\n1.1 The NXT holders from the original Nxt Public Blockchain Platform as\nmaintained by Jelurida Swiss SA must be allocated at least 10% (ten percent) of\nthe forging tokens in the new DLT Instance, proportional to their NXT holdings,\n\nOR\n\n1.2 The forging token holders from a DLT Instance which is based on the NRS that\nhas already satisfied the JPL airdrop requirement, are allocated 100% (one\nhundred percent) of the forging tokens in that new DLT Instance, proportional to\ntheir forging token holdings.\n\nThe first case covers clones and forks of the Nxt platform, and ensures that NXT\nowners will receive an airdrop from any such clone or fork launched in the\nfuture, or any existing Nxt clone that decides to upgrade to this NRS version or\ncopy or backport code from it.\n\nThe second case is to cover forks of Nxt clones which have already satisfied the\nJPL airdrop, as by definition at the time of the hard fork all accounts start\nwith the same balances on either fork, and it would be difficult to make a hard\nfork satisfy the first condition. The Nxt holders who received the airdrop\nwould still have the same balances on either fork.\n\n\nArticle 2. In both cases (Articles 1.1 or 1.2 of the Special Conditions), token\nholdings must be calculated based on a snapshot taken not earlier than 3 months\nbefore the launch of the new DLT Instance. For a new DLT Instance, the snapshot\nshould also be taken not later than 24 h before the launch, to avoid the\nuncertainty due to the 720 blocks rolling checkpoint.\n\n\nArticle 3.\n\n3.1 There should be under no circumstances any restrictions or any type of\ndiscrimination against accounts receiving tokens as an airdrop.\n\n3.2 If token distribution must be restricted by some criteria that not all\nexisting NXT holders can potentially satisfy, a specific exemption from the full\nJPL airdrop requirements must be obtained in advance. The Copyright Holder\nreserves the right to not grant such exemption, or to require a commercial\nlicense in such situations, to be decided on a case by case basis.\n\n3.3 As internal (private) use of Nxt software for evaluating and testing\npurposes cannot satisfy the JPL airdrop requirement, any such use will also\nrequire an evaluation license agreement with the Copyright Holder if it lasts\nlonger than 3 months.\n\n3.4 Nothing in this license shall be understood as giving NXT token holders the\nright to hold the Licensor, its affiliate parties, or sublicensors, liable in\ncase the NXT holders do not obtain any airdrop, or liable for not taking action\nto enforce the airdrop requirement, or for not observing, verifying or\nmonitoring the compliance with any airdrop. The Licensor also retains the right\nto change the percentage of the airdrop requirement in Article 1.1 or to\ncompletely eliminate this airdrop requirement at any time.\n\n\nArticle 4. DLT Instances that by design do not use a fixed number of tokens\nissued all at once, or that have substituted the proof-of-stake algorithm with a\ndifferent one and as a result do not use forging tokens, have to contact the\nCopyright Holder for a custom license agreement. However the Copyright Holder is\nin no way obliged to provide such a custom license.\n\n\nArticle 5. Interpretation\nYou agree that you may not, for the purpose of interpretation of this License,\nrefer to, or construe this License on the basis of, or use as counterevidence,\nany prior agreements, arrangements, understandings and statements, or other\nbilateral or public licenses, and to this extent agree (i) that this License\nqualifies as an agreed rule of evidence within the meaning of article 153 Dutch\nCode of Civil Proceedings and (ii) that this clause serves as a determination\nagreement within the meaning of article 7:900 Dutch Civil Code, and that this\nLicense shall be interpreted or construed by assuming the most obvious\ngrammatical meaning of the wording of this License.\n\n\nArticle 6. Governing law\nThis License, the documents related to it and any agreement that incorporates\nany of these are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws\nof the Netherlands. Any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with\nthis License, the documents related to it and any agreement that incorporates\nany of these shall be exclusively referred to the competent court in Amsterdam,\nthe Netherlands.",

We recognize the fundamental advantages that the decentralized ledger\ntechnology has to offer and we truly believe in its potential to change the\nworld for the better. Therefore we wish to continue the already established\ntradition to publish blockchain software as an open source and in this way to\ngive our contribution to the further development of the blockchain technology\nworld-wide. At the same time we wish to protect our IP rights and to address the\nfact that our software was copied many times during its existence and as a\nresult a lot of “clones” have been created which dilute the value of the tokens\nwith no significant technological improvements behind them.\n\nThe exact terms and conditions for using, copying and modification follow:\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nI. General Conditions\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe existent copyleft licensing models were designed to protect the value of the\ncode which is created in open source projects. They make sure anyone who builds\non top of this code also releases their code under the same copyleft license,\nthus sharing back with the community and the developers of the original project\nthe added value of the derived work.\n\nCopyleft licenses however were created long before crypto currency and\nblockchain technologies appeared, and could not have anticipated the fact that\ntoday the value of an open source distributed ledger project is contained not\nonly in the program code being written, but in the unique public blockchain\ninstance or crypto currency token, maintained by this project, with its\ndevelopers, community and holders sharing the common interest to preserve and\nincrease the value of this blockchain token.\n\nCrypto currency tokens today have value of their own, people can buy, sell and\ninvest in them and the unlimited permission of cloning the existing blockchain\nplatforms and creating new coins inevitably results in decreasing the value of\nthe original tokens.\n\nCrypto currency tokens are also an inseparable part of each distributed ledger\nsoftware, without which such software cannot really be used. Ensuring that a\nclone project shares back the modified source code is no longer sufficient to\nallow the users of the original project access to that derived work, unless they\nare also allocated some of the newly created tokens in the clone blockchain\ninstance. Thus such allocation is important in order to preserve not only the\nvalue of the original tokens, but also to preserve the users freedom to use any\nworks derived from the original software.\n\nWith the above being said, the terms and conditions for using, copying and\nmodification of distributed ledger software programs are outlined below, called\nthe Jelurida Public License (JPL). The JPL is inspired by the GNU General Public\nLicense versions 2 and 3, with adaptations specifically aimed at application of\nthe license to distributed ledger software programs; as such the GNU General\nPublic License and any other license terms and conditions other than this JPL\nare explicitly excluded.\n\n\nJPL version: 1.1\n\n\nArticle 0. Definitions:\n\n“based on [the Program/Covered Work/…]” means derived from the original Covered\nWork (or part thereof) by the act(s) of copying it, modifying it, including it\n(in whole or in part) or by linking to the original Covered Work (or part\nthereof).\n\n“to convey”: To convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a\ncomputer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nCopyright Holder, Licensor: The owner of the IP rights over the software as\ndetermined by applicable national law and international treaty provisions\nregulating this subject matter.\n\nCorresponding Source: The Corresponding Source for a work in Object Code form\nmeans all the Source Code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the Object Code and to modify the work, including scripts to control\nthose activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or\ngeneral-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used\nunmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.\nFor example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated\nwith source files for the work, and the Source Code for shared libraries and\ndynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to\nrequire, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not\ninclude anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the\nCorresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in Source Code form is\nthat same work.\n\nCovered Work: A DLT Software or another Program based on a DLT or otherwise, or\nbased on another Covered Work, their Object Code and Source Code, and any other\nwork covered by this License according to their terms.\n\nDLT Instance: Unique instance of distributed ledger consisting of a network of\none or more participants (nodes) running a particular DLT Software and which\nnodes are in a state of consensus with each other within the permitted\ntolerances of the applicable consensus algorithm. An example of such DLT\ninstance is the Nxt public blockchain.\n\nDLT Software: Any distributed ledger computer technology including but not\nlimited to blockchain technology regardless of the way the consensus is\nestablished.\n\nGeneral Conditions: Chapter I. General Conditions of this License.\n\nLicense: This Jelurida Public License (JPL) consisting of both General\nConditions and Special Conditions.\n\nLicensee, You: Everyone (natural person or legal entity) who wants to use, copy,\ndistribute, modify or build on top of the Program.\n\n“to modify”: To modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the\nwork in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier\nwork or a “work based on” the earlier work. Modification also includes\ntranslation into another programming language or human language.\n\nObject Code: Any non-Source Code form of a work.\n\nProgram: Any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\n\n“to propagate”: To propagate a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\napplicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a\nprivate copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without\nmodification), making available to the public, and in some countries other\nactivities as well.\n\nSource Code: The Source Code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.\n\nSpecial Conditions: Chapter II. Special Conditions of this License which\ncontains additional provisions required and adapted by the Licensor according to\nthe specific Covered Work they are applicable to.\n\nStandard Interface: An interface that either is an official standard defined by\na recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a\nparticular programming language, one that is widely used among developers\nworking in that language.\n\nSystem Libraries: Libraries of an executable work, other than the work as a\nwhole, that (a) are included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,\nbut which are not part of that Major Component, and (b) serve only to enable use\nof the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for\nwhich an implementation is available to the public in Source Code form. A Major\nComponent, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window\nsystem, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the\nexecutable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an Object Code\ninterpreter used to run it.\n\n\nArticle 1. Scope of the License:\n\n1.1 This License applies to any Covered Work or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the Copyright Holder saying it may be used, propagated,\nconveyed or modified only under the terms of this License. It also applies to\nany work which is not a DLT per se but is still a Covered Work because it is\nbased on the covered DLT Software or contains a portion of it. This is to ensure\nthat if such work is included into another DLT Software that DLT Software must\nsatisfy the below stated airdrop requirement and other terms of this License.\n\n1.2. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright\non the Covered Work, and are irrevocable provided the conditions of this License\nare met.\n\n1.3 The act of running a Program is not restricted as long as it does not\nviolate Article 3.4 of the General Conditions, and the output from a Program is\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\nof having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\nwhat the Program does.\n\n1.4 Conveying is permitted solely under the conditions stated herein.\nSublicensing is not allowed; Article 7 of the General Conditions makes it\nunnecessary.\n\n1.5 No Covered Work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\nunder any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\ncopyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\nrestricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a Covered Work, you\nwaive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the\nextent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License\nwith respect to the Covered Work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the\nwork's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n\nArticle 2.\n\n2.1 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Covered Work’s Source\nCode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Covered\nWork a copy of this License along with the Covered Work.\n\n2.2 You must keep intact all authorship and copyright notices and when conveying\nor offering to convey copies (verbatim or modified) you must also avoid any\nmisrepresentation of the origin of the Covered Work. You must make sure that any\nmodified versions of such Covered Work are marked in reasonable ways as\ndifferent from the original version and they do not imply any endorsement or\nsupport by the Copyright Holder regarding this modified work.\n\n2.3 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy (for the\navoidance of doubt, such physical act of transfer may include making the copy\navailable on your website or otherwise), and you may at your discretion and\nresponsibility offer support or warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You\nare not allowed to charge any fee for granting the right to further use,\npropagate, convey or modify the copy then obtained by the acquirer, as such\nwould be against the intention of this License.\n\n\nArticle 3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Covered Work or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Covered Work, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Article 2 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n3.1 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\nyou changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n3.2 You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in\npart contains or is derived from the Covered Work or any part thereof, to be\nlicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\nLicense.\n\n3.3 If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\nmust cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\nordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\ncopyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\nyou provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under the\nconditions of this License, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense. (Exception: if the Covered Work itself is interactive but does not\nnormally print such an announcement, your work based on the Covered Work is not\nrequired to print an announcement.) If the program has graphical user interface\nany such notices should be placed in an about dialog or similar.\n\n3.4 If the Covered Work is a DLT Software, after your modifications it must\ncontinue to work with the original DLT Instance without violating the consensus\nalgorithm or resulting in a permanent fork. For the purpose of this clause\nmodification also includes changing the configuration or network environment in\nwhich the Covered Work is run that results in permanent disconnection, fork or\nisolation from the original DLT Instance. If your modifications result in a\ndifferent DLT Instance you must satisfy the following airdrop requirement:\n\n3.4.1 The token holders from the original distributed ledger instance shall be\nallocated a portion (an \"airdrop\") of the tokens in that new DLT Instance\nproportional to their token balances. This shall also apply to anyone who\nintends to make a copy of your copy, i.e. any such person needs to allocate the\nsame airdrop of the newly created tokens to the account holders from the\noriginal DLT Instance (not to your copy). If the Covered Work is not a DLT\nSoftware per se this requirement still applies to any other work based on or\nincluding this work or portions of it which is a DLT Software or in any other\nway distributes tokens to its users. The specific percentage of the airdrop\nand the tokens to which it applies, which may also depend on how the new DLT\nInstance relates to the original one, are defined in the Special Conditions.\n\n3.5 All other provisions, designated in the Special Conditions and consistent\nwith the specific requirements arising from the architecture of each particular\ndecentralized ledger/consensus platform, are observed as well.\n\n3.6 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Covered Work, and can be\nreasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this\nLicense, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you convey them as\nseparate works. But when you convey the same sections as part of a whole which\nis a work based on the Covered Work, the conveyance of the whole must be on the\nterms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Mere\naggregation of another work not based on the Covered Work with the Covered Work\n(or with a work based on the Covered Work) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n\nArticle 4. You may convey a Covered Work in Object Code form under the terms of\nArticles 2 and 3 of the General Conditions, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of\nthese ways:\n\n4.1 Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\nphysical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on\na durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n4.2 Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\nphysical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at\nleast three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer\nsupport for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the Object Code\neither (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your\nreasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access\nto copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n4.3 Convey individual copies of the Object Code with a copy of the written offer\nto provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\noccasionally and non-commercially, and only if you received the Object Code with\nsuch an offer, in accord with Article 4.2 above.\n\n4.4 Convey the Object Code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or\nfor a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the\nsame way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require\nrecipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the Object Code. If the\nplace to copy the Object Code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may\nbe on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports\nequivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to\nthe Object Code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of\nwhat server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that\nit is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n4.5 Convey the Object Code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform\nother peers where the Object Code and Corresponding Source of the work are being\noffered to the general public at no charge under Article 4.4 above.\n\n4.6 A separable portion of the Object Code, whose Source Code is excluded from\nthe Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying\nthe Object Code work.\n\n\nArticle 5. You may not use, copy, modify, or propagate the Covered Work except\nas expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to use, copy,\nmodify or  propagate the Covered Work is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n\nArticle 6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, use, modify or\npropagate Covered Works. These actions are prohibited if you do not accept this\nLicense. Therefore, by modifying or propagating the Covered Work, you indicate\nyour acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for,\nas specified in the General Conditions and Special Conditions, copying, using,\npropagating or modifying the Covered Work.\n\n\nArticle 7. Each time you convey the Covered Work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original Licensor to use, copy, propagate or modify\nthe Covered Work subject to terms and conditions at least equal and in\naccordance with this License. In this regard, the license granted on behalf of\nthe original Licensor by the propagator of the Covered Work may amend this\nLicense only to the following extent:\n\n7.1 You can add additional airdrop requirements towards the holders of your\nunique DLT Instance as long as those do not in any way reduce or interfere with\nthe airdrop owed to the original DLT Instance account holders.\n\n7.2 If the distribution and/or use of the Covered Work is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents, by copyrighted interfaces or by law, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Covered Work under this License may add an\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n\nArticle 8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not propagate the Covered Work at\nall. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Covered Work by all those who receive copies directly or\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Covered Work.\n\n\nArticle 9. Jelurida IP B.V. may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nJelurida Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns. To avoid ambiguity, everyone who wishes to use the text of the\nJelurida Public License must always specify under which version of the JPL\ntheir Covered Work is released.\n\n\nArticle 10. Every Copyright Holder is permitted to use the text of the Jelurida\nPublic License for their own Covered Work provided that they: (i) keep the name\nJelurida Public License (you can append the name of the specific DLT Instance,\ne.g. \"Jelurida Public License version 1.0 for the Nxt Public Blockchain\"),\n(ii) remove the Preamble and (iii) do not change the General Conditions. Every\nCopyright Holder is permitted to adapt the Special Conditions to their specific\ncase under (i), (ii) and (iii) above to the extent that they do not contradict\nthe General Conditions nor the spirit of the Jelurida Public License.\n\n\nArticle 11. If the Special Conditions contradict the General Conditions or any\npart of them, the provisions of the General Conditions shall take precedence.\n\n\nArticle 12. If you cannot satisfy Article 3.4 and 3.4.1 of the General\nConditions or you are not willing to do so, or if you require a customized DLT\nInstance for internal use (i.e. a private blockchain) based on the DLT Software\nyou must obtain permission or purchase a commercial license from the original\nCopyright Holder however he is not in any way obliged to grant permission or\nsell such a license.\n\n\nArticle 13. No warranty\n\nTHE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE COVERED WORK \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nCOVERED WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE COVERED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\nArticle 14.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDER OR ANY OTHER PARTY  WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nCOVERED WORK AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL  OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE COVERED WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR\nDATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE COVERED WORK TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH\nHOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU\nINDEMNIFY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONVEYOR OF THE COVERED WORK OF ANY LIABILITY\nVIS-À-VIS ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE COVERED WORK AS USED, COPIED,\nPROPAGATED OR MODIFIED BY YOU.\n\n\nArticle 15.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot\nbe given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall\napply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil\nliability in connection with the Covered Work, unless a warranty or assumption\nof liability accompanies a copy of the Covered Work in return for a fee.\n\n\nII. Special Conditions\n\nArticle 0. The Copyright Holder of the Nxt Reference Software (NRS) is Jelurida\nIP B.V.\n\n\nArticle 1. The airdrop requirement of Article 3.4.1 of the General Conditions,\nas related to the Nxt Reference Software (NRS) is the following:\n\n1.1 The NXT holders from the original Nxt Public Blockchain Platform as\nmaintained by Jelurida Swiss SA must be allocated at least 10% (ten percent) of\nthe forging tokens in the new DLT Instance, proportional to their NXT holdings,\n\nOR\n\n1.2 The forging token holders from a DLT Instance which is based on the NRS that\nhas already satisfied the JPL airdrop requirement, are allocated 100% (one\nhundred percent) of the forging tokens in that new DLT Instance, proportional to\ntheir forging token holdings.\n\nThe first case covers clones and forks of the Nxt platform, and ensures that NXT\nowners will receive an airdrop from any such clone or fork launched in the\nfuture, or any existing Nxt clone that decides to upgrade to this NRS version or\ncopy or backport code from it.\n\nThe second case is to cover forks of Nxt clones which have already satisfied the\nJPL airdrop, as by definition at the time of the hard fork all accounts start\nwith the same balances on either fork, and it would be difficult to make a hard\nfork satisfy the first condition. The Nxt holders who received the airdrop\nwould still have the same balances on either fork.\n\n\nArticle 2. In both cases (Articles 1.1 or 1.2 of the Special Conditions), token\nholdings must be calculated based on a snapshot taken not earlier than 3 months\nbefore the launch of the new DLT Instance. For a new DLT Instance, the snapshot\nshould also be taken not later than 24 h before the launch, to avoid the\nuncertainty due to the 720 blocks rolling checkpoint.\n\n\nArticle 3.\n\n3.1 There should be under no circumstances any restrictions or any type of\ndiscrimination against accounts receiving tokens as an airdrop.\n\n3.2 If token distribution must be restricted by some criteria that not all\nexisting NXT holders can potentially satisfy, a specific exemption from the full\nJPL airdrop requirements must be obtained in advance. The Copyright Holder\nreserves the right to not grant such exemption, or to require a commercial\nlicense in such situations, to be decided on a case by case basis.\n\n3.3 As internal (private) use of Nxt software for evaluating and testing\npurposes cannot satisfy the JPL airdrop requirement, any such use will also\nrequire an evaluation license agreement with the Copyright Holder if it lasts\nlonger than 3 months.\n\n3.4 Nothing in this license shall be understood as giving NXT token holders the\nright to hold the Licensor, its affiliate parties, or sublicensors, liable in\ncase the NXT holders do not obtain any airdrop, or liable for not taking action\nto enforce the airdrop requirement, or for not observing, verifying or\nmonitoring the compliance with any airdrop. The Licensor also retains the right\nto change the percentage of the airdrop requirement in Article 1.1 or to\ncompletely eliminate this airdrop requirement at any time.\n\n\nArticle 4. DLT Instances that by design do not use a fixed number of tokens\nissued all at once, or that have substituted the proof-of-stake algorithm with a\ndifferent one and as a result do not use forging tokens, have to contact the\nCopyright Holder for a custom license agreement. However the Copyright Holder is\nin no way obliged to provide such a custom license.\n\n\nArticle 5. Interpretation\nYou agree that you may not, for the purpose of interpretation of this License,\nrefer to, or construe this License on the basis of, or use as counterevidence,\nany prior agreements, arrangements, understandings and statements, or other\nbilateral or public licenses, and to this extent agree (i) that this License\nqualifies as an agreed rule of evidence within the meaning of article 153 Dutch\nCode of Civil Proceedings and (ii) that this clause serves as a determination\nagreement within the meaning of article 7:900 Dutch Civil Code, and that this\nLicense shall be interpreted or construed by assuming the most obvious\ngrammatical meaning of the wording of this License.\n\n\nArticle 6. Governing law\nThis License, the documents related to it and any agreement that incorporates\nany of these are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws\nof the Netherlands. Any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with\nthis License, the documents related to it and any agreement that incorporates\nany of these shall be exclusively referred to the competent court in Amsterdam,\nthe Netherlands.",
